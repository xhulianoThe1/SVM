# SVM and Logistical Regression 


* Developed a NLP model to try and predict price movements for US tech stocks, based on keywords in financial news headlines. 
* Retrieved news headlines using a Twitter API in Python to identify keywords frequently associated with positive returns for Tesla and FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks. 
* Implemented SVM and Logistical Regressions to predict changes in stock returns, using stock/sector/market momentum and volatility (quantitative data), along with keywords in recent news headlines (natural language data). 
* Worked with Maksim Papenkov and Jacob Rosenberg
