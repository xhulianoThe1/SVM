# SVM

Methods: Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM; Linear, Radial)

* We retrieve news headlines using a Twitter API in Python to identify keywords frequently associated with positive returns for FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and Tesla stocks. 
* We implement an SVM model to predict changes in stock returns, using stock/sector/market momentum and volatility (quantitative data), along with keywords in recent news headlines (natural language data).
